Crypto.com DeFi Swap 是 Uniswap V2 的一个分支，为流动性提供者提供三倍收益激励，由 CRO 提供支持。 Uniswap V2 经 dapp.org 审核，Crypto.com DeFi Swap 于 2020 年 9 月 11 日在以太坊主网上上线。
在推出 DeFi Swap 之前，Crypto.com 的安全团队以及慢雾科技的区块链研究人员对智能合约和 DeFi 运营模式进行了审计。
此外，所有 DeFi 交换协议和支持组件都包含在 Crypto.com HackerOne 漏洞赏金计划中。
协议中有5个主要功能：

  交换：用户可以在支付 0.3% 的交换费后在任意两个支持的代币之间进行交换
  池：每个流动性池由两个 ERC-20 代币的储备组成，并发行一个 ERC-20 池代币作为基础储备比例所有权的证明
  提升：LP 可以增加、声明和查看他们的 CRO DeFi 收益和奖金 LP 收益
  APY：用户可以估算他们的 CRO DeFi Yield
  分析：用户可以查看CRO DeFi Swap协议的整体和每个代币/对的数据，包括流动性、交易量等。 <p>Crypto.com DeFi Swap is a fork of Uniswap V2 with Triple Yield incentives provided for liquidity providers, powered by CRO.
